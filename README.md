A mock up social media application using ReactJs that is connected with another REST API built with Node-Express 
for the backend that allows users to create an account, sign in, posting messages, uploading images, 
updating their status, editing or deleting said posts only if allowed; it uses an external database 
(NoSQL MongoDB Compass) to store and read the generated data.
